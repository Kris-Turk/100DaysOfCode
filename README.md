# Introduction

Welcome to my 100 days of Code (Python). The repo starts from Day 15 as I have been using [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 - By Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and the first 14 days she uses REPLIT.

If you really want  to see the first 14 days they are available at [my replit](https://replit.com/@swip/) how ever I strongly suggest simply purchasing the same course for Â£14.99 (I think) when its on special an following along your self.

The point of this Git is simply for my own tracking and accountability.

At this time I have created no documentation for each day's project's, although I may go back and fill in days 15-22 retrospectively at some point.

# Day 24
